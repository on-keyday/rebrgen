# Architecture

##### generated by AI

This document describes the architecture of the code generator project, a subproject of [brgen](https://github.com/on-keyday/brgen).

## Overview

This project is a C++-based code generator that automatically creates structures, encoders/decoders, and associated functions from binary format definitions written in a DSL.

## Components

### src/old/bmgen

This directory contains the logic for converting brgen's AST into an intermediate representation defined in `src/old/bm/binary_module.bgn`. This intermediate representation is designed to be easily transformed by the code generators.

### src/old/bm2

This directory contains the common logic for the language-specific code generators, as well as a code generator that generates code generators from the intermediate representation. The implementation for the code generator generator is in `src/old/bm2/gen_template.cpp`.

### src/old/bm2\*

These directories contain the code generator implementations for different languages. Each directory is named `src/old/bm2[language]`, where `[language]` is the target language (e.g., `src/old/bm2py` for Python, `src/old/bm2c` for C).
