# bm2python Hook Files

#### AI generated

This document describes how the hook files are used in `src/old/bm2python/bm2python.cpp`.

## Hook File Usage

### `func_elif_after.txt`

This hook is loaded in the `inner_function` function, within the `ELIF` case of the `switch` statement. It's loaded after writing the `elif` condition.

**Purpose:**

Adds a `pass` statement if the next operation is `BEGIN_COND_BLOCK` or the next line. This ensures that the `elif` block is not empty.

### `func_call_encode.txt`

This hook is loaded in the `inner_function` function, within the `CALL_ENCODE` case. It's loaded before writing the code that calls the encode function.

**Purpose:**

1.  Checks if the object is an instance of the function's belonging class. If it's not, it returns `False`.
2.  Includes the content of `func_call_code_common.txt`.

### `func_call_code_common.txt`

This hook is loaded by `func_call_encode.txt`.

**Purpose:**

Writes the code that calls the function with the appropriate parameters and handles the result.

## Summary

The hook files are used to inject custom code into the generated Python code. This allows for fine-grained control over the code generation process.
