### **Handover to Gemini: `gen_template2` Development Progress**

**0. Important Context and Prerequisites**

Before diving into the `gen_template2` project, it is crucial to understand the broader context and the rationale behind this development.

*   **Project Overview:** Documents located in `../.clinerules` provide a comprehensive overview of the `rebrgen` project.
*   **Project Rationale:** The `refactoring plan` (`../docs/refactoring_plan.md`) and `complexity reduction plan` (`../docs/complexity_reduction_plan.md`) explain why this project is necessary and the strategic goals it aims to achieve. These documents are essential for understanding the design decisions and the long-term vision for `gen_template2`.

**1. Project Objective and Current Status**

`gen_template2` is a new generator within the `rebrgen` project, designed to convert `brgen`'s Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) (`rebgn::BinaryModule`) into C++ code. Its goal is to resolve the complexities of the traditional `gen_template` by adopting a structured, AST-based code generation approach.

Currently, basic AST nodes (`Literal`, `BinaryOpExpr`, `UnaryOpExpr`, `VariableDecl`, `IfStatement`, `LoopStatement`, `FunctionCall`, `IndexExpr`) and their concise helper functions (`lit`, `bin_op`, etc.) are defined and functional in `src/bm2/gen_template2/ast.hpp`.

A fundamental pipeline for constructing these AST nodes from `rebgn::BinaryModule` and rendering them as C++ code is implemented in `src/bm2/gen_template2/code_gen_map.hpp`.

**2. Implemented `rebgn::AbstractOp` Types**

The following `AbstractOp` types have been successfully converted from `rebgn::BinaryModule` to AST and generate C++ code:

*   `IMMEDIATE_INT`
*   `IMMEDIATE_STRING`
*   `IMMEDIATE_TRUE`
*   `IMMEDIATE_FALSE`
*   `IMMEDIATE_INT64`
*   `IMMEDIATE_CHAR`
*   `IMMEDIATE_TYPE`
*   `EMPTY_PTR`
*   `EMPTY_OPTIONAL`
*   `PHI`
*   `DECLARE_VARIABLE`
*   `DEFINE_VARIABLE_REF`
*   `BEGIN_COND_BLOCK`
*   `BINARY`
*   `UNARY`
*   `ASSIGN`
*   `PROPERTY_ASSIGN`
*   `ASSERT`
*   `LENGTH_CHECK`
*   `IF` (including full `ELIF` and `ELSE` structures)
*   `LOOP_INFINITE`
*   `LOOP_CONDITION`
*   `RETURN_TYPE`
*   `DEFINE_VARIABLE`
*   `ACCESS`
*   `INDEX`
*   `ARRAY_SIZE`
*   `APPEND`
*   `INC`

**3. Current Challenges and Unresolved Issues**

*   **`EXPLICIT_ERROR` Handling:**
    *   A runtime error "cannot access to empty optional" occurs during the processing of `EXPLICIT_ERROR` (`AbstractOp 96`).
    *   This issue is believed to stem from a discrepancy between the principle that `binary_module.bgn` is the Root of Trust and the generated code in `binary_module.hpp` and `binary_module.cpp`.
    *   While `abstract_ops.json` defines `EXPLICIT_ERROR` with a `param: "Param"`, `union_struct_116` (which corresponds to `EXPLICIT_ERROR` in `binary_module.hpp`'s `Code` struct) contains `Param param; Varint belong;`.
    *   It is suspected that the `Code::param()` getter/setter might not be correctly handling the combination of `EXPLICIT_ERROR` `AbstractOp` and `Param` type.
    *   Currently, the `EXPLICIT_ERROR` test case in `main.cpp` is commented out, and `generate_explicit_error_statement` in `code_gen_map.hpp` has been reverted to use `code.param()->refs[0].value()`.
    *   **The next task is to prioritize resolving this `EXPLICIT_ERROR` issue.** This will require a detailed analysis of the `Code::param()` getter/setter implementation in `binary_module.cpp` to accurately determine how `Param` data for `EXPLICIT_ERROR` should be stored and accessed.

**4. Changes in Development Approach**

*   **Incremental Implementation and Frequent Verification:** Instead of debugging multiple issues simultaneously, the approach has shifted to focusing on implementing one `AbstractOp` at a time, followed by frequent build and execution verification.
*   **Introduction of AST Helper Functions:** To reduce the verbosity of directly using `std::make_unique`, AST helper functions like `lit()`, `bin_op()`, and `var_decl()` have been introduced, simplifying AST construction syntax.
*   **Clarification of Root of Trust:** The principle that `binary_module.bgn` is the ultimate Root of Trust has been clarified. If any discrepancies are found between `binary_module.bgn` and the `hpp` or `cpp` files, it is understood that the generated files might be incorrect or my understanding is flawed. In such cases, **I will not proceed with my own judgment but will always seek confirmation from you, the user.**

**5. Debugging and Verification Process**

Debugging code generation is a multi-layered challenge. The following systematic approach is used to identify and resolve issues:

*   **Pinpointing Crash/Error Location:**
    *   Simplify `main.cpp` test cases to test only one `AbstractOp` or a small, related group at a time.
    *   Strategically place `std::cerr` debug outputs to print the `AbstractOp` type, `code_idx`, and values of relevant references during processing.
    *   Before calling `value()` on `std::optional`, always check `has_value()` and report an error if the value is absent.
*   **Inspecting Data Structures:**
    *   Verify the contents of `rebgn::BinaryModule` (`bm`), especially `bm.code` (the linear sequence of `rebgn::Code` objects), to ensure `op` types and `ref` values are as expected.
    *   Inspect `bm2::Context` (`ctx`), particularly `ctx.ident_table` (identifier-to-string mapping) and `ctx.ident_index_table` (identifier-to-`bm.code` index mapping), to confirm correct mappings.
    *   Ensure the `bm2::Context` constructor correctly populates these tables from `bm.identifiers.refs` and `bm.ident_indexes.refs`.
*   **Tracing AST Generation and Structure:**
    *   Follow the execution flow through `generate_expression_from_code` and `generate_statement_from_code`. For each `AbstractOp`, verify that the correct generator function is called and that data is correctly extracted from the `rebgn::Code` object.
    *   Consider adding print statements to inspect the structure of generated `std::unique_ptr<Statement>` or `std::unique_ptr<Expression>` before rendering (e.g., by adding a `to_string()` method to AST nodes for debugging).
*   **Verifying Rendered Output:**
    *   Once the program runs without crashing, carefully compare the generated C++ code with the expected output.
    *   Pay close attention to syntax (parentheses, semicolons, keywords), indentation, and logic to ensure it accurately reflects the intended `AbstractOp` sequence.
    *   Confirm that references are correctly translated into variable names or other expressions.

**6. Build and Execution Commands**

*   **Build Command:**
    ```bash
    python script/build.py native Debug
    ```
    This command builds the project in debug mode.
*   **Execution Command:**
    ```bash
    C:/workspace/shbrgen/rebrgen/tool/gen_template2.exe --lang test
    ```
    This command runs the generated executable, executing the test cases defined in `main.cpp`.

**7. Next Starting Point**
