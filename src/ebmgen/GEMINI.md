### `src/ebmgen` Development Progress: Redefining the Intermediate Representation

This document chronicles the evolution of the `ExtendedBinaryModule` (EBM), the new Intermediate Representation (IR) for `rebrgen`, and the design philosophy behind `ebmgen`, the compiler responsible for generating this IR from the `brgen` Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

#### 1. Initial Analysis of `src/bm/binary_module.bgn` and `src/bmgen`

Our initial analysis of the existing `BinaryModule` (`src/bm/binary_module.bgn`) and `bmgen` revealed several key challenges:

*   **Overly Granular `AbstractOp`s:** The original `AbstractOp` enum was highly detailed and often tied to low-level, C++-specific operations (e.g., `ENCODE_INT`, `DECODE_INT_VECTOR_FIXED`). This made the IR less abstract and tightly coupled to a particular implementation style.
*   **Implicit Control Flow:** Control flow constructs were represented by `BEGIN_X`/`END_X` markers, requiring complex logic in both `bmgen` and downstream `bm2*` backends to reconstruct program structure.
*   **Lack of Semantic Information in `Code` struct:** Generic `Varint`s for references led to ambiguity and runtime interpretation overhead.
*   **Verbose Type Handling:** The `Storage` and `Storages` formats resulted in extensive boilerplate code.

#### 2. Clarified Architectural Roles and Core Semantics

A crucial clarification was made regarding the project's architecture and the nature of a binary format definition language:

*   **`bmgen` as Compiler Frontend & IR Optimizer:** `bmgen`'s role is to translate the `brgen` AST into the IR and perform IR-level optimizations. It is *not* responsible for target code generation.
*   **`bm2*` as Compiler Backends:** The `bm2*` tools are the language-specific backends that consume the IR and generate final code.
*   **Binary Format Semantics in IR:** For a binary format definition language, properties like **endianness, bit size, and specific data layouts are not platform-specific implementation details to be abstracted away.** Instead, they are **core, integral semantic properties of the binary format itself, defined within the DSL.** The IR *must* explicitly capture these details to enable correct code generation by backends across diverse programming paradigms (from assembly to functional languages).

#### 3. Design Principles for the New `ExtendedBinaryModule`

Based on the refined understanding, the `ExtendedBinaryModule` (defined in `src/ebm/extended_binary_module.bgn`) was designed with the following principles:

*   **Preserving Core Binary Semantics:** The IR explicitly retains crucial binary format details like endianness (`EndianExpr`) and precise data types (`Type` format with `size` for `INT`/`UINT`/`FLOAT`). This ensures that backends have all necessary information to correctly interpret and generate code for the binary format.
*   **Higher-Level, Abstract Operations:** The `AbstractOp` enum was significantly reduced and made more abstract. Operations like `READ_DATA`, `WRITE_DATA`, `SEEK_STREAM` replace many granular, instruction-like operations. This allows backends greater flexibility in how they implement these actions idiomatically in their respective languages.
*   **Graph-Based Structure:** The IR now represents a graph of operations rather than a linear instruction stream. `Expression` and `Statement` are top-level tables (`expressions`, `statements`) referenced by `ExpressionRef` and `StatementRef`. This enables advanced compiler optimizations (e.g., CSE, DCE) and provides a more flexible structure for backends.
*   **Explicit Structured Control Flow:** `IfStatement`, `LoopStatement`, and `MatchStatement` formats explicitly define control flow with their conditions and `Block`s. This eliminates the need for implicit `BEGIN_X`/`END_X` markers and simplifies analysis for backends.
*   **Stronger Typing for References:** Dedicated reference formats (`IdentifierRef`, `TypeRef`, `ExpressionRef`, `StringRef`, `StatementRef`) provide explicit, type-safe links between IR nodes, improving clarity and reducing ambiguity.
*   **Centralized Data Tables:** `identifiers`, `strings`, `types`, `statements`, and `expressions` are all centralized, promoting data deduplication and consistency.

#### 4. Current Status and Next Steps

*   **Successful IR Definition:** The `src/ebm/extended_binary_module.bgn` file has been successfully defined and parsed by `src2json`.
*   **Generated C++ Bindings:** The corresponding C++ header (`extended_binary_module.hpp`) and source (`extended_binary_module.cpp`) files have been successfully generated, providing the necessary data structures for `ebmgen` and `bm2*` tools to interact with the new IR.

Our next step is to begin the implementation of `ebmgen`, focusing on translating the `brgen` AST into this newly defined `ExtendedBinaryModule` structure, and then implementing the IR-to-IR optimization passes.
