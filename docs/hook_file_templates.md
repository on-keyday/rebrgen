## Hook File Templates

The `bm2` code generator uses a set of template files, referred to as "Hook Files", to generate code for different languages. These templates allow for customization of the generated code, such as specifying language-specific syntax, data types, and code structures. Hook files are located in the `src/bm2{lang_name}/hook/` directories.

The `src/bm2/gen_template/` directory contains the core logic for reading and processing these hook files. The `src/bm2/gen_template.cpp` file is responsible for reading the template files and using them to generate code. The `may_write_from_hook` function reads the content of a template file and inserts it into the generated code.

The `src/bm2/gen_template/hook_list.bgn` file defines an enum `HookFile` that lists all available template files.

### Template Categories

The Hook File templates are categorized into several groups:

- **General file structure:** These templates define the overall structure of the generated file.

  - `file_top.txt`: Contains the code that is placed at the beginning of the generated file, such as includes and namespace declarations.
  - `file_top_after.txt`: Contains code placed after the initial file setup.
  - `file_bottom.txt`: Contains the code that is placed at the end of the generated file.

- **Context definitions:** These templates define the context object that is used during code generation.

- **Command-line flag definitions:** These templates define the command-line flags that are used to configure the code generator.

  - `flags.txt`: Contains the definitions for the command-line flags.

- **Inner function/block related templates:** These templates define the structure of inner functions and blocks of code.

  - `inner_function_start.txt`: Contains the code that is placed at the beginning of an inner function.
  - `inner_function_each_code.txt`: Contains the code that is executed for each instruction within an inner function.
  - `inner_block_start.txt`: Contains the code that is placed at the beginning of an inner block.
  - `inner_block_each_code.txt`: Contains the code that is executed for each instruction within an inner block.

- **Parameter related templates:** These templates define how parameters are handled in the generated code.

  - `param_start.txt`: Contains the code that is placed at the beginning of a parameter list.
  - `param_each_code.txt`: Contains the code that is executed for each parameter in a parameter list.
  - `call_param_start.txt`: Contains the code that is placed at the beginning of a function call's parameter list.
  - `call_param_each_code.txt`: Contains the code that is executed for each parameter in a function call's parameter list.

- **Operation-specific templates:** These templates define the code that is generated for specific abstract operations.
  - `inner_function_op.txt`: Contains the code that is generated for a specific abstract operation within an inner function. The template file name is formatted as `func_{}.txt`, where `{}` is replaced with the lowercase name of the abstract operation.
  - `inner_block_op.txt`: Contains the code that is generated for a specific abstract operation within an inner block. The template file name is formatted as `block_{}.txt`, where `{}` is replaced with the lowercase name of the abstract operation.
  - `eval_op.txt`: Contains the code that is generated for evaluating a specific abstract operation. The template file name is formatted as `eval_{}.txt`, where `{}` is replaced with the lowercase name of the abstract operation.
  - `type_op.txt`: Contains the code that is generated for a specific storage type. The template file name is formatted as `type_{}.txt`, where `{}` is replaced with the lowercase name of the storage type.
  - `param_op.txt`: Contains the code that is generated for a specific abstract operation when defining parameters. The template file name is formatted as `param_{}.txt`, where `{}` is replaced with the lowercase name of the abstract operation.
  - `call_param_op.txt`: Contains the code that is generated for a specific abstract operation when calling functions with parameters. The template file name is formatted as `call_param_{}.txt`, where `{}` is replaced with the lowercase name of the abstract operation.

### Usage

The `gen_template.cpp` file reads the binary module and iterates through its code, using the `AbstractOp` enum to determine the type of instruction. For each instruction, it calls the `may_write_from_hook` function with the appropriate `HookFile` enum value to insert the corresponding template code into the generated code.

The template files can contain placeholders that are replaced with language-specific values. These placeholders are defined and managed within the `src/bm2/gen_template/` directory.

### Parameters and Variables

The `docs/template_parameters.md` file describes the variables that can be used in the code generator-generator hooks. These include:

- **Words:**

  - `reference`: A reference to a several object in the binary module.
  - `type reference`: A reference to a type in the binary module.
